🏥 ## Problem Statement:
A clinic has been receiving numerous complaints about long wait times from patients. Addressing this is critical to improving patient satisfaction, operational efficiency, and overall healthcare delivery.

🔍 ## Analysis Overview:
After conducting a thorough analysis of hospital data, the following key insights and recommendations emerged:

📊 ## Key Findings:
1. Overall Wait Time Analysis:
The average wait time (38.91) is significant (benchmark in US 30 minutes, p-value: 0.001), highlighting a systemic issue that requires immediate attention.
High variability in wait times during peak periods indicates potential bottlenecks in patient flow.

2. Time-Based Patterns:
Certain days of the week consistently experience longer wait times.
Peak hours during the day lead to substantial increases in wait times.
🔹 Recommendations:
Adjust staffing levels for high-volume days.
Improve appointment scheduling to manage peak hours effectively.
Allocate additional resources during busy periods.

3. Doctor Type Impact:
Wait times differ notably across various doctor types and specialties.
🔹 Recommendations:
Address potential understaffing in specific specialties.
Develop and implement optimized scheduling algorithms.
Redistribute patient loads more evenly among available doctors.

4. Financial Class Analysis:
Patients from different financial classes experience varying wait times.
🔹 Recommendations:
Address inefficiencies in handling certain insurance types.
Streamline documentation and check-in processes.
